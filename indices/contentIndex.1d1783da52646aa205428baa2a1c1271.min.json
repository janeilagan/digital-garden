Seedling development starts with germination of the seed. A typical young seedling consists of three main parts: the radicle (embryonic root), the hypocotyl (embryonic shoot), and the cotyledons (seed leaves). The two classes of flowering plants (angiosperms) are distinguished by their numbers of seed leaves: monocotyledons (monocots) have one blade-shaped cotyledon, whereas dicotyledons (dicots) possess two round cotyledons. Gymnosperms are more varied. For example, pine seedlings have up to eight cotyledons. The seedlings of some flowering plants have no cotyledons at all. These are said to be acotyledons.\n\n## [bud](bud.md)\n\nIn botany, a bud is an undeveloped or embryonic shoot and normally occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem. Once formed, a bud may remain for some time in a dormant condition, or it may form a shoot immediately","lastmodified":"2022-11-03T21:22:49.8824208+08:00","tags":null},"/shrub":{"title":"A bit grown plant","content":"## watering the plants\n\nlet them grow!\n\n* [a tree maybe](a%20tree%20maybe.md)\n* [wilted](wilted.md)","lastmodified":"2022-11-03T21:22:49.8778702+08:00","tags":null},"/wilted":{"title":"Dried Sunflower","content":"Dried flowers last **an average of one year** and when the dried flowers are dyed, they even last a couple of years.
