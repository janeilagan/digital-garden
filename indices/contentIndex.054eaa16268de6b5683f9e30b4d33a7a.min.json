The doctor turned quickly and looked out the tall hospital window. The baby had been born without ears.\n\nTime proved that the baby’s hearing was perfect. It was only his appearance that was marred.\n\nWhen he rushed home from school one day and flung himself into his mother’s arms, she sighed, knowing that his life was to be a succession of heartbreaks.\n\nHe blurted out the tragedy: “A boy, a big boy… called me a freak.”\n\nHe grew up, handsome for his misfortune. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music. “But you might mingle with other young people,” his mother reproved him, but felt a kindness in her heart.\n\nThe boy’s father had a session with the family physician. Could nothing be done? “I believe I could graft on a pair of outer ears, if they could be procured,” the doctor decided.\n\nWhereupon the search began for a person who would make such a sacrifice for a young man. Two years went by.\n\nThen, “You are going to the hospital, Son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it’s a secret,” said the father.\n\nThe operation was a brilliant success, and a new person emerged. His talents blossomed into genius, and school and college became a series of triumphs. Later he married and entered the diplomatic service.\n\n“But I must know!” He urged his father, “Who gave so much for me? I could never do enough for him.”\n\n“I do not believe you could,” said the father, “but the agreement was that you are not to know … not yet.”\n\nThe years kept their profound secret, but the day did come … one of the darkest days that a son must endure. He stood with his father over his mother’s casket. Slowly, tenderly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish-brown hair to reveal that the mother — had no outer ears.\n\n“Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut,” he whispered gently, “and nobody ever thought Mother less beautiful, did they?”\n\nReal beauty lies not in the physical appearance, but in the heart. Real treasure lies not in what that can be seen, but what that cannot be seen. Real love lies not in what is done and known, but in what that is done but not known.\n\nSource: unknown\n\nCredits: whoever had written this \n\n(I had this saved in my high school notes)","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T14:01:44.0088052+08:00","tags":null},"/Loss-of-Breath":{"title":"Loss of Breath","content":"---\n\nOriginal: [Loss of Breath.pdf](attachments/Loss%20of%20Breath.pdf)\n\nBy: Edgar Allan Poe\n\nWriting to express, not to impress. That has been the path of words I had been walking to since I started writing. Not literary scratching letters unto paper, but making things alive through my words. I love how with every stroke of my pen, I can paint kaleidoscopic scene of angels wings into the orange canvas of sky, only by my words I can become a painter. I like it how to people fall in love so recklessly through every words and characters I give them, then I become Cupid. I chose my medium carefully, because I know, I don’t have to deliver perfection but understanding. I want my readers to understand what I mean, and that is a gift I want to share to them. I want them to understand my thoughts and at some points, persuade them to agree with me.\n\nBut at Loss of Breath, I honestly don’t feel like it. All those words and thoughts that few people not of my kind would understand. I was thinking, did Edgar really want to share the thoughts of his story? Or he just want to merely impress his readers? Is the story written for a specific target of readers? Because if it was, I’ll bet it was written for scholars, linguistics, grammarians and stuffs. His brush of words are a little crowded for his canvas, and I can’t really think whether it was a portrait or landscape, because as I view it, it was abstract.\n\nCutting the story short, it was sort of a humorous story, I would suppose. I was kind of thinking whether there was really a medical situation called “loss of breath”. Well, it could refer to shortness of breath I would suppose, but this does differently. You entirely lose your breath to the point that they will think you are dead. Pity. At two points, I look through it. The first one is sex, the highest satisfaction human can attain. At the first part, I looked at it as if the lead guy was talking dirty to his wife. Well, at some points. The second one is well, the humorous comprehension to the story. The he-thought-his-wife-cheats-at-him thing, the he-was-buried-alive-with-his-wife’s-lover irony of life, and the they-helped-each-other-to-get-out ending.\n\nThe story is too subtle, the way I understood it. Only decorated and flowered with words that are hard to be understood easily. After I read it, I felt like I had wasted all my time understanding it. But at some points, I tried to decode if this has any other meaning. I usually do that stuff, especially with the books of Bob Ong, who happens to be the mirror side of Loss of Breath. Bob Ong uses shallow words, but has deep thoughts. Same as my all-time favorite book, The Little Prince of Antoine de Saint Exupery, with too light terms that even a first grade student would understand, but only a heart dedicated reader could comprehend. Loss of Breath was a total difference. It used lots of decorations only to find out that this has nothing to do with reality.\n\nWell that was my point of view. I don’t really believe that you have to use deep words to say you are an effective writer. All you have to do is put your heart to your words and everything will follow.\n\nFor thou shall feel, thou shall love. Thou shalt not impress.

Maybe it was when I was just a kid and excited for the Christmas morning. Maybe it was the night before my parents told me we’re gonna be visiting the zoo back when I was seven. Being this nervous about something means it’s something I really want.\n\nThe moment I read the Train Story, I was hooked. I’ve read it another four to five times, I even made an offline copy of the website page for my phone. Working with outsourcing companies for as long as I can remember, I’ve always felt like we’re factories of knowledge and services which the companies use for profit. It’s not a bad thing, as I’m learning along the way.\n\nBut upon stumbling through Insentra’s values, I couldn’t believe there’s still a company that’s actually pro-employee. If the people who work on the train aren’t happy, the passengers won’t come back. And I like how it is that simple. I like how they value what others have already forgotten - honesty, integrity, trust. My grandmother had always said to find a guy with those values and marry him. (Well Grandma, I found a company, does that count?)\n\nBeing accountable for your actions, and celebrating the right things done. When efficiency doesn’t mean you’re underutilized. And service excellence internally will deliver service excellence externally. It’s like saying how you treat your workers will reflect on how they will treat your customers. And it shows.\n\nOne Team, One Dream - helping each other out and learning from each other. There will be things you know that your team doesn’t, and vice versa. Working as one means learning as one.\n\nI love how the Train Story was well written. You’d know that it wasn’t written for promotion and marketing, because you can sense the feelings of it even through the screen. You can sense the thoughtfulness and honesty of it. It’s exciting to scroll through my phone reading it and seeing that the scrollbar has more to load - more to know about Insentra.\n\nI even sent the link to few of my close friends asking them to read all through it- as it’s worth it.\n\nIt didn’t just motivate me to learn more, it motivated me to be a better version of myself. Knowing that there’s a possibility of joining a company that’s going to help me grow in all different ways, I didn’t want to miss the chance.\n\nI’ve always been a technical kid growing up. When my mom bought her first phone, I was the first to learn it even though I’m just on second grade. I would always excel in computer subjects and eventually took Bachelor in Science of Information Technology. It excites me to learn how things work, how it makes life easier. It excites me to automate something and testing it and knowing it works. And when I found out that Insentra’s offering an opportunity to work and learn more about so many technologies, I wanted a ticket to board the train and go to places I’ve never been.\n\nIf there’s a carriage in the train that could fit me in, then I’m all aboard.","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T14:01:43.9275911+08:00","tags":null},"/PSADT":{"title":"PSADT","content":"* Source: [PSAppDeployToolkit](https://psappdeploytoolkit.com/)\n\n* Download here: [Releases · PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit · GitHub](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/releases)\n\n* Download [ServiceUI](ServiceUI.md) for prompts\n\n* References: [Using PSADT to bring system prompts to the user context (call4cloud.nl)](https://call4cloud.nl/2021/01/the-amazing-psadt/)\n\n* The extract will contain\n\n* ![](attachments/341ee52d9d4fc5b9101e07f727c74e51.png)\n\n* Add the [ServiceUI](ServiceUI.md) to the ToolKit location\n\n* Paste your installer files inside \"Files\" folder\n\n* Update the Deploy-Application.ps1 file\n\n* ![](attachments/c685f6c89e20a4a134d4e3afc363f46e.png)\n\n* Insert the Installation task script \n\n* Test the package on sandbox\n\n* `.\\[[ServiceUI]].exe -Process:explorer.exe Deploy-Application.exe`\n\n* ![](attachments/0e6aa4e9ee665ad6f5b5fc1c740113c6.png)\n\n* Once working, package using [IntuneWinAppUtil](IntuneWinAppUtil.md) \n\n[tech notes](public/tech%20notes.md)","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T14:01:43.9687642+08:00","tags":null},"/PowerShell-Extract-Zip-to-path":{"title":"PowerShell - Extract Zip to path","content":"## Extract zip to path\n\n[PowerShell](PowerShell.md)\n\n````powershell\nif(!(Test-Path -Path \"$env:TEMP\\Profile\")){\n    Expand-Archive .\\Profile.zip -DestinationPath $env:TEMP -Force \n}\n````\n\n[tech notes](tech%20notes.md)","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T14:01:43.9559216+08:00","tags":null},"/Road-to-Masters":{"title":"Road to masters","content":"---","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T14:01:43.9992155+08:00","tags":null},"/SC200":{"title":"SC-200 Microsoft Security Operations Analyst","content":"Related: [i said I'll study](i%20said%20I'll%20study.md)\n\nUdemy course: [SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst (udemy.com)](https://blueapache.udemy.com/course/sc-200-microsoft-security-operations-analyst-exam-prep/learn/lecture/29680320#content)\n\nGreat Resources: [What's Microsoft Defender for identity? - GitBit](https://www.gitbit.org/course/ms-500/learn/Whats-Microsoft-Defender-for-identity-Kye_yNLxA)\n\n## Security Operations Model\n\n[Understand Microsoft 365 Defender in a Security Operations Center (SOC) - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/introduction-microsoft-365-threat-protection/3-understand-defender-security-operations-center)\n\n1.

You can’t change other people, and it’s rude to try.\n\n1. It is a hundred times more difficult to burn calories than to refrain from consuming them in the first place.\n\n1. If you’re talking to someone you don’t know well, you may be talking to someone who knows way more about whatever you’re talking about than you do.\n\n1. The cheapest and most expensive models are usually both bad deals.\n\n1. Everyone likes somebody who gets to the point quickly.\n\n1. Bad moods will come and go your whole life, and trying to force them away makes them run deeper and last longer.\n\n1. Children are remarkably honest creatures until we teach them not to be.\n\n1. If everyone in the TV show you’re watching is good-looking, it’s not worth watching.\n\n1. Yelling always makes things worse.\n\n1. Whenever you’re worried about what others will think of you, you’re really just worried about what you’ll think of you.\n\n1. Every problem you have is your responsibility, regardless of who caused it.\n\n1. You never have to deal with more than one moment at a time.\n\n1. If you never doubt your beliefs, then you’re wrong a lot.\n\n1. Managing one’s wants is the most powerful skill a person can learn.\n\n1. Nobody has it all figured out.\n\n1. Cynicism is far too easy to be useful.\n\n1. Every passing face on the street represents a story every bit as compelling and complicated as yours.\n\n1. Whenever you hate something, it hates you back: people, situations and inanimate objects alike.\n\n1. Ralph Waldo Emerson’s works alone can teach you everything you need to know about living with grace and happiness.\n\n1. People embellish everything, as a rule.\n\n1. Anger reveals weakness of character, violence even moreso.\n\n1. Humans cannot destroy the planet, but we can destroy its capacity to keep us alive. And we are.\n\n1. When people are uncomfortable with the present moment, they fidget with their hands or their minds. Watch and see.\n\n1. Those who complain the most, accomplish the least.\n\n1. Putting something off makes it instantly harder and scarier.\n\n1. Credit card debt devours souls.\n\n1. Nobody knows more than a minuscule fraction of what’s going on in the world. It’s just way too big for any one person to know it well.\n\n1. Most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.\n\n1. A person who is unafraid to present a candid version of herself to the world is as rare as diamonds.\n\n1. The most common addiction in the world is the draw of comfort.

If you aren’t happy single, you won’t be happy in a relationship.\n\n1. Even if it costs no money, nothing is free if it takes time.\n\n1. Emotions exist to make us strongly biased towards or against something. This hinders as often as it helps.\n\n1. Addiction is a much greater problem in society than it’s made out to be. It’s present in every person in various forms, but usually we call it something else.\n\n1. “Gut feeling” is not just a euphemism.

The secret ingredient is usually butter, in obscene amounts.\n\n1. It is worth re-trying foods that you didn’t like at first.\n\n1.

North Americans are generally terrible at accepting compliments and offers of help.\n\n1. There are not enough women in positions of power. The world has suffered from this deficit for a long time.\n\n1. When you break promises to yourself, you feel terrible. When you make a habit of it, you begin to hate yourself.\n\n1. A good nine out of ten bad things I’ve worried about never happened. A good nine out of ten bad things that did happen never occurred to me to worry about.\n\n1. You can’t hide a bad mood from people who know you well, but you can always be polite.\n\n1. Sometimes you have to remove certain people from your life, even if they’re family.\n\n1. Anyone can be calmed in an instant by looking at the ocean or the stars.\n\n1. There is no point finishing a book you aren’t enjoying. Life is too short for that.

Breaking new ground only takes a small amount more effort than you’re used to giving.\n\n1. Life is a solo trip, but you’ll have lots of visitors. Some of them are long-term, most aren’t.\n\n1. One of the best things you can do for your kids is take them on road trips. I’m not a parent, but I was a kid once.\n\n1. The fewer possessions you have, the more they do for you.\n\n1. Einstein was wiser than he was intelligent, and he was a genius.\n\n1. When you’re sick of your own life, that’s a good time to pick up a book.\n\n1. Wishing things were different is a great way to torture yourself.\n\n1. The ability to be happy is nothing other than the ability to come to terms with how things change.\n\n1. Killing time is an atrocity. It’s priceless, and it never grows back.","lastmodified":"2022-11-28T14:01:44.0262038+08:00","tags":null},"/Turn-off-Macro-in-Office-Apps":{"title":"Turn off Macro in Office Apps","content":"Resources: \n\n* [Disable Macros in Microsoft Office using Group Policy – E-N Computers (encomputers.com)](https://www.encomputers.com/2018/05/disable-macros-in-microsoft-office-using-group-policy/)\n\n* [Block Internet Macros For Office Applications Using Intune Group Policy HTMD Blog (anoopcnair.com)](https://www.anoopcnair.com/block-internet-macros-for-office-apps-intune/)\n\n* Q/A: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/disable-office-365-macro-via-gpo/24c54ff3-7644-4972-864a-4f0c1b58e7b6\n\n* Official docs: [Macros from the internet are blocked by default in Office - Deploy Office | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/security/internet-macros-blocked#block-macros-from-running-in-office-files-from-the-internet)\n\n* [Cloud Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/security/internet-macros-blocked#cloud-policy)\n  \n  * Requirements\n    * Version should be [supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date#supported-versions)\n    * Account is signed in to office apps\n    * For Windows devices, policies are enforced based on the primary user that is signed into Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.
