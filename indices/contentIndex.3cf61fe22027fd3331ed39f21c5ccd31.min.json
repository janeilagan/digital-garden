Professionally, I work in IT, but I enjoy tech in general.\n\nI tend to get lost in the rabbit hole of *attempting* to build my second brain using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). The intent of this site is to become my [digital garden](https://janeilagan.github.io/digital-garden) and not a formal blog. It's less focused on polishing what I put here, so if you see any dead links, those are probably ideas not cultivated yet, or they link to my private notes inside my vault. \n\nThere is no defined topic as to what I'll be publishing here, ranging from cringe-y notes I wrote when I was younger, to tech notes, or random weird *things*.\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe retrospectively. Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime.
