The doctor turned quickly and looked out the tall hospital window. The baby had been born without ears.\n\nTime proved that the baby‚Äôs hearing was perfect. It was only his appearance that was marred.\n\nWhen he rushed home from school one day and flung himself into his mother‚Äôs arms, she sighed, knowing that his life was to be a succession of heartbreaks.\n\nHe blurted out the tragedy: ‚ÄúA boy, a big boy‚Ä¶ called me a freak.‚Äù\n\nHe grew up, handsome for his misfortune. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music. ‚ÄúBut you might mingle with other young people,‚Äù his mother reproved him, but felt a kindness in her heart.\n\nThe boy‚Äôs father had a session with the family physician. Could nothing be done? ‚ÄúI believe I could graft on a pair of outer ears, if they could be procured,‚Äù the doctor decided.\n\nWhereupon the search began for a person who would make such a sacrifice for a young man. Two years went by.\n\nThen, ‚ÄúYou are going to the hospital, Son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it‚Äôs a secret,‚Äù said the father.\n\nThe operation was a brilliant success, and a new person emerged. His talents blossomed into genius, and school and college became a series of triumphs. Later he married and entered the diplomatic service.\n\n‚ÄúBut I must know!‚Äù He urged his father, ‚ÄúWho gave so much for me? I could never do enough for him.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI do not believe you could,‚Äù said the father, ‚Äúbut the agreement was that you are not to know ‚Ä¶ not yet.‚Äù\n\nThe years kept their profound secret, but the day did come ‚Ä¶ one of the darkest days that a son must endure. He stood with his father over his mother‚Äôs casket. Slowly, tenderly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish-brown hair to reveal that the mother ‚Äî had no outer ears.\n\n‚ÄúMother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut,‚Äù he whispered gently, ‚Äúand nobody ever thought Mother less beautiful, did they?‚Äù\n\nReal beauty lies not in the physical appearance, but in the heart. Real treasure lies not in what that can be seen, but what that cannot be seen. Real love lies not in what is done and known, but in what that is done but not known.\n\nSource: unknown\n\nCredits: whoever had written this \n\n(I had this saved in my high school notes)","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T06:09:32.5104557+08:00","tags":null},"/Loss-of-Breath":{"title":"Loss of Breath","content":"---\n\nOriginal: [Loss of Breath.pdf](attachments/Loss%20of%20Breath.pdf)\n\nBy: Edgar Allan Poe\n\nWriting to express, not to impress. That has been the path of words I had been walking to since I started writing. Not literary scratching letters unto paper, but making things alive through my words. I love how with every stroke of my pen, I can paint kaleidoscopic scene of angels wings into the orange canvas of sky, only by my words I can become a painter. I like it how to people fall in love so recklessly through every words and characters I give them, then I become Cupid. I chose my medium carefully, because I know, I don‚Äôt have to deliver perfection but understanding. I want my readers to understand what I mean, and that is a gift I want to share to them. I want them to understand my thoughts and at some points, persuade them to agree with me.\n\nBut at Loss of Breath, I honestly don‚Äôt feel like it. All those words and thoughts that few people not of my kind would understand. I was thinking, did Edgar really want to share the thoughts of his story? Or he just want to merely impress his readers? Is the story written for a specific target of readers? Because if it was, I‚Äôll bet it was written for scholars, linguistics, grammarians and stuffs. His brush of words are a little crowded for his canvas, and I can‚Äôt really think whether it was a portrait or landscape, because as I view it, it was abstract.\n\nCutting the story short, it was sort of a humorous story, I would suppose. I was kind of thinking whether there was really a medical situation called ‚Äúloss of breath‚Äù. Well, it could refer to shortness of breath I would suppose, but this does differently. You entirely lose your breath to the point that they will think you are dead. Pity. At two points, I look through it. The first one is sex, the highest satisfaction human can attain. At the first part, I looked at it as if the lead guy was talking dirty to his wife. Well, at some points. The second one is well, the humorous comprehension to the story. The he-thought-his-wife-cheats-at-him thing, the he-was-buried-alive-with-his-wife‚Äôs-lover irony of life, and the they-helped-each-other-to-get-out ending.\n\nThe story is too subtle, the way I understood it. Only decorated and flowered with words that are hard to be understood easily. After I read it, I felt like I had wasted all my time understanding it. But at some points, I tried to decode if this has any other meaning. I usually do that stuff, especially with the books of Bob Ong, who happens to be the mirror side of Loss of Breath. Bob Ong uses shallow words, but has deep thoughts. Same as my all-time favorite book, The Little Prince of Antoine de Saint Exupery, with too light terms that even a first grade student would understand, but only a heart dedicated reader could comprehend. Loss of Breath was a total difference. It used lots of decorations only to find out that this has nothing to do with reality.\n\nWell that was my point of view. I don‚Äôt really believe that you have to use deep words to say you are an effective writer. All you have to do is put your heart to your words and everything will follow.\n\nFor thou shall feel, thou shall love. Thou shalt not impress. Just perspicuously avow what was there to be expressed, fathom what is there to be understood. For there is no ecstasy and euphoria much splendid than divulging your contemplations to folks who apprehend you. In my terms? Just feel it. Writing is all about expressing, not impressing.","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T06:09:32.5246479+08:00","tags":null},"/Merge-Excel-Files":{"title":"Merge Excel Files","content":"Merge excel files using [PowerShell](PowerShell.md)\n\n````powershell\n\n$ExcelObject=New-Object -ComObject excel.application\n$ExcelObject.visible=$true\n$ExcelFiles=Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\Users\\janea\\Downloads\\AdminDroid\n\n$Workbook=$ExcelObject.Workbooks.add()\n$Worksheet=$Workbook.Sheets.Item(\"Sheet1\")\n\nforeach($ExcelFile in $ExcelFiles){\n \n$Everyexcel=$ExcelObject.Workbooks.Open($ExcelFile.FullName)\n$Everysheet=$Everyexcel.sheets.item(1)\n$Everysheet.Copy($Worksheet)\n$Everyexcel.Close()\n \n}\n$Workbook.SaveAs(\"C:\\Users\\janea\\Downloads\\AdminDroid\\merge.xlsx\")\n$ExcelObject.Quit()\n\n````\n\n[tech notes](tech%20notes.md)","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T06:09:32.5316698+08:00","tags":null},"/Meteorite":{"title":"Meteorite","content":"also: [some old poetry i wrote when I was young](some%20old%20poetry%20i%20wrote%20when%20I%20was%20young.md)\n\n$~$\n\nCareless whispers surround the night\n\nStars twinkle under the foggy twilight \n\nA shooting star emerged, giving a sight\n\nKindling my heart like a candlelight\n\n$~$\n\nYou were seen in sight, but unreachable like heaven\n\nTwo feet away, yet too distant to happen\n\nLonging for your closeness is what I had wished \n\nBefore the unpredicted meteor vanished\n\n$~$\n\nSurrounded by distractions that fill us afar\n\nCrowded, yet emptiness is all that we are\n\nSleepy eyelids fluttering to dream\n\nYet somehow your eyes still shine agleam\n\n$~$\n\nAs I bade goodbye, I pray you walk me home\n\nLike when we used to, in this small town, roam\n\nIt used to be us, tonight you latch unto them\n\nOur secret foregone, we have long condemned","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T06:09:32.5412695+08:00","tags":null},"/Notes-on-Train-Story":{"title":"Notes on Train Story","content":"Insentra's Train Story:  [Insentra Train Story - Insentra Australia (insentragroup.com)](https://www.insentragroup.com/au/insights/not-geek-speak/business/insentra-train-story/)\n\nI cant recall the last time I was this giddy about something. Maybe it was when I was just a kid and excited for the Christmas morning. Maybe it was the night before my parents told me we‚Äôre gonna be visiting the zoo back when I was seven. Being this nervous about something means it‚Äôs something I really want.\n\nThe moment I read the Train Story, I was hooked. I‚Äôve read it another four to five times, I even made an offline copy of the website page for my phone. Working with outsourcing companies for as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve always felt like we‚Äôre factories of knowledge and services which the companies use for profit. It‚Äôs not a bad thing, as I‚Äôm learning along the way.\n\nBut upon stumbling through Insentra‚Äôs values, I couldn‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs still a company that‚Äôs actually pro-employee. If the people who work on the train aren‚Äôt happy, the passengers won‚Äôt come back. And I like how it is that simple. I like how they value what others have already forgotten - honesty, integrity, trust. My grandmother had always said to find a guy with those values and marry him. (Well Grandma, I found a company, does that count?)\n\nBeing accountable for your actions, and celebrating the right things done. When efficiency doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre underutilized. And service excellence internally will deliver service excellence externally. It‚Äôs like saying how you treat your workers will reflect on how they will treat your customers. And it shows.\n\nOne Team, One Dream - helping each other out and learning from each other. There will be things you know that your team doesn‚Äôt, and vice versa. Working as one means learning as one.\n\nI love how the Train Story was well written. You‚Äôd know that it wasn‚Äôt written for promotion and marketing, because you can sense the feelings of it even through the screen. You can sense the thoughtfulness and honesty of it. It‚Äôs exciting to scroll through my phone reading it and seeing that the scrollbar has more to load - more to know about Insentra.\n\nI even sent the link to few of my close friends asking them to read all through it- as it‚Äôs worth it.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt just motivate me to learn more, it motivated me to be a better version of myself. Knowing that there‚Äôs a possibility of joining a company that‚Äôs going to help me grow in all different ways, I didn‚Äôt want to miss the chance.\n\nI‚Äôve always been a technical kid growing up. When my mom bought her first phone, I was the first to learn it even though I‚Äôm just on second grade. I would always excel in computer subjects and eventually took Bachelor in Science of Information Technology. It excites me to learn how things work, how it makes life easier. It excites me to automate something and testing it and knowing it works. And when I found out that Insentra‚Äôs offering an opportunity to work and learn more about so many technologies, I wanted a ticket to board the train and go to places I‚Äôve never been.\n\nIf there‚Äôs a carriage in the train that could fit me in, then I‚Äôm all aboard.","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T06:09:32.5549594+08:00","tags":null},"/PSADT":{"title":"PSADT","content":"* Source: [PSAppDeployToolkit](https://psappdeploytoolkit.com/)\n\n* Download here: [Releases ¬∑ PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/releases)\n\n* Download [ServiceUI](ServiceUI.md) for prompts\n\n* References: [Using PSADT to bring system prompts to the user context (call4cloud.nl)](https://call4cloud.nl/2021/01/the-amazing-psadt/)\n\n* The extract will contain\n\n* ![](attachments/341ee52d9d4fc5b9101e07f727c74e51.png)\n\n* Add the [ServiceUI](ServiceUI.md) to the ToolKit location\n\n* Paste your installer files inside \"Files\" folder\n\n* Update the Deploy-Application.ps1 file\n\n* ![](attachments/c685f6c89e20a4a134d4e3afc363f46e.png)\n\n* Insert the Installation task script \n\n* Test the package on sandbox\n\n* `.\\[[ServiceUI]].exe -Process:explorer.exe Deploy-Application.exe`\n\n* ![](attachments/0e6aa4e9ee665ad6f5b5fc1c740113c6.png)\n\n* Once working, package using [IntuneWinAppUtil](IntuneWinAppUtil.md) \n\n[tech notes](tech%20notes.md)","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T06:09:32.4494439+08:00","tags":null},"/PowerShell":{"title":"PowerShell","content":"---\n\nOR: [i said I'll study](i%20said%20I'll%20study.md)\n\n## Fundamentals\n\n* [Variables](Variables) - store values and use as arguments\n* [Functions](Functions) - list of statements or reusable commands\n* [Flow Control](Flow%20Control) - If, ElseIf, Else\n* [Loops](Loops) - ForEach, Do-While, Do\n* [Error handling](Error%20handling) - Try, Catch, Finally\n* [Expressions](Expressions) - operators and operands, computation - [Expressions - PowerShell | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/lang-spec/chapter-07?view=powershell-7.2)\n\n## Scope\n\n* [Global Scope](Global%20Scope) - continues to exist after session ends\n* [Script Scope](Script%20Scope) - no longer exists after file is finished running.\n* [Local scope](Local%20scope) - current scope, can be [Global Scope](Global%20Scope) or [Script Scope](Script%20Scope)\n\n### Scope rules\n\n* Scopes can nest\n* Items are visible in the current and child scopes\n* Items can be changed only in the created scope\n\n## Parameters\n\nSource: [Exercise - Parameters - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/script-with-powershell/5-exercise-parameters)\n\n* use to make scripts flexible\n* allows options or inputs from users\n* [cmdlets](cmdlets), [Functions](Functions), [scripts](scripts) can all accept parameters\n* all are optional by default\n* [switch](../private/switch.md)\n\n### Declaration\n\n`Param()`\n\n````powershell\n# Create-File.ps1\n\nParam(\n\t$Path\n)\n\nNew-Item $Path\nWrite-Host \"File $Path was created\"\n````\n\n### Usage\n\n````powershell\n./Create-File.ps1 -Path c:\\temp\n\n````\n\n### Mandatory parameters\n\n`¬† [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]`\n\n#### Usage\n\n````powershell\n¬†Param(\n\n¬† ¬† [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\n\n¬† ¬† [String] $AdminSiteURL,\n\n¬† ¬† [String] $ReportOutput\n\n¬†)\n````\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!NOTE\\] Summary\n \u003e Using parameters can be set as switches on the script\n \u003e \n \u003e Param(\n \u003e $**Path**\n \u003e )\n \u003e \n \u003e ./Create-File.ps1 -**Path**\n\n### Improving parameters\n\n* setup optional or required parameters\n* setup what allowed values can be\n* can it accept more than one type of value?

You can‚Äôt change other people, and it‚Äôs rude to try.\n\n1. It is a hundred times more difficult to burn calories than to refrain from consuming them in the first place.\n\n1. If you‚Äôre talking to someone you don‚Äôt know well, you may be talking to someone who knows way more about whatever you‚Äôre talking about than you do.\n\n1. The cheapest and most expensive models are usually both bad deals.\n\n1. Everyone likes somebody who gets to the point quickly.\n\n1. Bad moods will come and go your whole life, and trying to force them away makes them run deeper and last longer.\n\n1. Children are remarkably honest creatures until we teach them not to be.\n\n1. If everyone in the TV show you‚Äôre watching is good-looking, it‚Äôs not worth watching.\n\n1. Yelling always makes things worse.\n\n1. Whenever you‚Äôre worried about what others will think of you, you‚Äôre really just worried about what you‚Äôll think of you.\n\n1. Every problem you have is your responsibility, regardless of who caused it.\n\n1. You never have to deal with more than one moment at a time.\n\n1. If you never doubt your beliefs, then you‚Äôre wrong a lot.\n\n1. Managing one‚Äôs wants is the most powerful skill a person can learn.\n\n1. Nobody has it all figured out.\n\n1. Cynicism is far too easy to be useful.\n\n1. Every passing face on the street represents a story every bit as compelling and complicated as yours.\n\n1. Whenever you hate something, it hates you back: people, situations and inanimate objects alike.\n\n1. Ralph Waldo Emerson‚Äôs works alone can teach you everything you need to know about living with grace and happiness.\n\n1. People embellish everything, as a rule.\n\n1. Anger reveals weakness of character, violence even moreso.\n\n1. Humans cannot destroy the planet, but we can destroy its capacity to keep us alive. And we are.\n\n1. When people are uncomfortable with the present moment, they fidget with their hands or their minds. Watch and see.\n\n1. Those who complain the most, accomplish the least.\n\n1. Putting something off makes it instantly harder and scarier.\n\n1. Credit card debt devours souls.\n\n1. Nobody knows more than a minuscule fraction of what‚Äôs going on in the world. It‚Äôs just way too big for any one person to know it well.\n\n1. Most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.\n\n1. A person who is unafraid to present a candid version of herself to the world is as rare as diamonds.\n\n1. The most common addiction in the world is the draw of comfort. It wrecks dreams and breaks people.\n\n1. If what you‚Äôre doing feels perfectly safe, there is probably a better course of action.\n\n1. The greatest innovation in the history of humankind is language.\n\n1. Blame is the favorite pastime of those who dislike responsibility.\n\n1. Everyone you meet is better than you at something.\n\n1. Proof is nothing but a collection of opinions that match your own.\n\n1. Knowledge is belief, nothing more.\n\n1. Indulging your desires is not self-love.\n\n1. What makes human beings different from animals is that animals can be themselves with ease.\n\n1. Self-examination is the only path out of misery.\n\n1. Whoever you are, you will die. To know and understand that means you are alive.\n\n1. Revenge is for the petty and irresponsible.\n\n1. Getting truly organized can vastly improve anyone‚Äôs life.\n\n1. Almost every clich√© contains a truth so profound that people have been compelled to repeat it until it makes you roll your eyes. But the wisdom is still in there.\n\n1. People cause suffering when they are suffering themselves. Alleviating their suffering will help them not hurt others.\n\n1. High quality is worth any quantity, in possessions, friends and experiences.\n\n1. The world would be a better place if everyone read National Geographic.\n\n1. If you aren‚Äôt happy single, you won‚Äôt be happy in a relationship.\n\n1. Even if it costs no money, nothing is free if it takes time.\n\n1. Emotions exist to make us strongly biased towards or against something. This hinders as often as it helps.\n\n1. Addiction is a much greater problem in society than it‚Äôs made out to be. It‚Äôs present in every person in various forms, but usually we call it something else.\n\n1. ‚ÄúGut feeling‚Äù is not just a euphemism. Tension in the abdomen speaks volumes about how you truly feel about something, beyond all arguments and rationales.\n\n1. Posture and dress change profoundly how you feel about yourself and how others feel about you, like it or not.\n\n1. Everyone thinks they‚Äôre an above average driver.\n\n1. The urge to punish others has much more to do with venting frustration than correcting behavior.\n\n1. By default, people think far too much.\n\n1. If anything is worth splurging on, it‚Äôs a high-quality mattress. You‚Äôll spend a third of your life using it.\n\n1. There is nothing worse than having no friends.\n\n1. To write a person off as worthless is an act of great violence.\n\n1. Try as we might to be otherwise, we are all hypocrites.\n\n1. Justice is a human invention which is in reality rarely achievable, but many will not hesitate to destroy lives demanding it.\n\n1. Kids will usually understand exactly what you mean if you keep it to one or two short sentences.\n\n1. Stuff that‚Äôs on sale usually has an annoying downside.\n\n1. Casual swearing makes people sound dumb.\n\n1. Words are immensely powerful. One cruel remark can wound someone for life.\n\n1. It‚Äôs easy to make someone‚Äôs day just by being uncommonly pleasant to them.\n\n1. Most of what children learn from their parents isn‚Äôt taught on purpose.\n\n1. The secret ingredient is usually butter, in obscene amounts.\n\n1. It is worth re-trying foods that you didn‚Äôt like at first.\n\n1. Problems, when they arise, are rarely as painful as the experience of fearing them.\n\n1. Nothing ‚Äî ever ‚Äî happens exactly like you pictured it.\n\n1. North Americans are generally terrible at accepting compliments and offers of help.\n\n1. There are not enough women in positions of power. The world has suffered from this deficit for a long time.\n\n1. When you break promises to yourself, you feel terrible. When you make a habit of it, you begin to hate yourself.\n\n1. A good nine out of ten bad things I‚Äôve worried about never happened. A good nine out of ten bad things that did happen never occurred to me to worry about.\n\n1. You can‚Äôt hide a bad mood from people who know you well, but you can always be polite.\n\n1. Sometimes you have to remove certain people from your life, even if they‚Äôre family.\n\n1. Anyone can be calmed in an instant by looking at the ocean or the stars.\n\n1. There is no point finishing a book you aren‚Äôt enjoying. Life is too short for that. Swallow your pride and put it down for good, unfinished.\n\n1. There is no correlation between the price of a brand of batteries and how long they last.\n\n1. Breaking new ground only takes a small amount more effort than you‚Äôre used to giving.\n\n1. Life is a solo trip, but you‚Äôll have lots of visitors. Some of them are long-term, most aren‚Äôt.\n\n1. One of the best things you can do for your kids is take them on road trips. I‚Äôm not a parent, but I was a kid once.\n\n1. The fewer possessions you have, the more they do for you.\n\n1. Einstein was wiser than he was intelligent, and he was a genius.\n\n1. When you‚Äôre sick of your own life, that‚Äôs a good time to pick up a book.\n\n1. Wishing things were different is a great way to torture yourself.\n\n1. The ability to be happy is nothing other than the ability to come to terms with how things change.\n\n1. Killing time is an atrocity. It‚Äôs priceless, and it never grows back.","lastmodified":"2022-11-23T06:09:32.475644+08:00","tags":null},"/When-Summer-and-Autumn-Collided":{"title":"When Summer and Autumn
