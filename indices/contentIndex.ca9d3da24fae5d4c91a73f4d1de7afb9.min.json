The doctor turned quickly and looked out the tall hospital window. The baby had been born without ears.\n\nTime proved that the baby‚Äôs hearing was perfect. It was only his appearance that was marred.\n\nWhen he rushed home from school one day and flung himself into his mother‚Äôs arms, she sighed, knowing that his life was to be a succession of heartbreaks.\n\nHe blurted out the tragedy: ‚ÄúA boy, a big boy‚Ä¶ called me a freak.‚Äù\n\nHe grew up, handsome for his misfortune. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music. ‚ÄúBut you might mingle with other young people,‚Äù his mother reproved him, but felt a kindness in her heart.\n\nThe boy‚Äôs father had a session with the family physician. Could nothing be done? ‚ÄúI believe I could graft on a pair of outer ears, if they could be procured,‚Äù the doctor decided.\n\nWhereupon the search began for a person who would make such a sacrifice for a young man. Two years went by.\n\nThen, ‚ÄúYou are going to the hospital, Son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it‚Äôs a secret,‚Äù said the father.\n\nThe operation was a brilliant success, and a new person emerged. His talents blossomed into genius, and school and college became a series of triumphs. Later he married and entered the diplomatic service.\n\n‚ÄúBut I must know!‚Äù He urged his father, ‚ÄúWho gave so much for me? I could never do enough for him.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI do not believe you could,‚Äù said the father, ‚Äúbut the agreement was that you are not to know ‚Ä¶ not yet.‚Äù\n\nThe years kept their profound secret, but the day did come ‚Ä¶ one of the darkest days that a son must endure. He stood with his father over his mother‚Äôs casket. Slowly, tenderly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish-brown hair to reveal that the mother ‚Äî had no outer ears.\n\n‚ÄúMother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut,‚Äù he whispered gently, ‚Äúand nobody ever thought Mother less beautiful, did they?‚Äù\n\nReal beauty lies not in the physical appearance, but in the heart. Real treasure lies not in what that can be seen, but what that cannot be seen. Real love lies not in what is done and known, but in what that is done but not known.\n\nSource: unknown\n\nCredits: whoever had written this \n\n(I had this saved in my high school notes)","lastmodified":"2022-11-10T09:28:41.2657979+08:00","tags":null},"/Merge-Excel-Files":{"title":"Merge Excel Files","content":"Merge excel files using [PowerShell](PowerShell.md)\n\n````powershell\n\n$ExcelObject=New-Object -ComObject excel.application\n$ExcelObject.visible=$true\n$ExcelFiles=Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\Users\\janea\\Downloads\\AdminDroid\n\n$Workbook=$ExcelObject.Workbooks.add()\n$Worksheet=$Workbook.Sheets.Item(\"Sheet1\")\n\nforeach($ExcelFile in $ExcelFiles){\n \n$Everyexcel=$ExcelObject.Workbooks.Open($ExcelFile.FullName)\n$Everysheet=$Everyexcel.sheets.item(1)\n$Everysheet.Copy($Worksheet)\n$Everyexcel.Close()\n \n}\n$Workbook.SaveAs(\"C:\\Users\\janea\\Downloads\\AdminDroid\\merge.xlsx\")\n$ExcelObject.Quit()\n\n````","lastmodified":"2022-11-10T09:28:41.2562392+08:00","tags":null},"/Meteorite":{"title":"Meteorite","content":"also: [some old poetry i wrote when I was young](some%20old%20poetry%20i%20wrote%20when%20I%20was%20young.md)\n\n$~$\n\nCareless whispers surround the night\n\nStars twinkle under the foggy twilight \n\nA shooting star emerged, giving a sight\n\nKindling my heart like a candlelight\n\n$~$\n\nYou were seen in sight, but unreachable like heaven\n\nTwo feet away, yet too distant to happen\n\nLonging for your closeness is what I had wished \n\nBefore the unpredicted meteor vanished\n\n$~$\n\nSurrounded by distractions that fill us afar\n\nCrowded, yet emptiness is all that we are\n\nSleepy eyelids fluttering to dream\n\nYet somehow your eyes still shine agleam\n\n$~$\n\nAs I bade goodbye, I pray you walk me home\n\nLike when we used to, in this small town, roam\n\nIt used to be us, tonight you latch unto them\n\nOur secret foregone, we have long condemned","lastmodified":"2022-11-10T09:28:41.2768886+08:00","tags":null},"/Notes-on-Train-Story":{"title":"Notes on Train Story","content":"Insentra's Train Story:  [Insentra Train Story - Insentra Australia (insentragroup.com)](https://www.insentragroup.com/au/insights/not-geek-speak/business/insentra-train-story/)\n\nI cant recall the last time I was this giddy about something. Maybe it was when I was just a kid and excited for the Christmas morning. Maybe it was the night before my parents told me we‚Äôre gonna be visiting the zoo back when I was seven. Being this nervous about something means it‚Äôs something I really want.\n\nThe moment I read the Train Story, I was hooked. I‚Äôve read it another four to five times, I even made an offline copy of the website page for my phone. Working with outsourcing companies for as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve always felt like we‚Äôre factories of knowledge and services which the companies use for profit. It‚Äôs not a bad thing, as I‚Äôm learning along the way.\n\nBut upon stumbling through Insentra‚Äôs values, I couldn‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs still a company that‚Äôs actually pro-employee. If the people who work on the train aren‚Äôt happy, the passengers won‚Äôt come back. And I like how it is that simple. I like how they value what others have already forgotten - honesty, integrity, trust. My grandmother had always said to find a guy with those values and marry him. (Well Grandma, I found a company, does that count?)\n\nBeing accountable for your actions, and celebrating the right things done. When efficiency doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre underutilized. And service excellence internally will deliver service excellence externally. It‚Äôs like saying how you treat your workers will reflect on how they will treat your customers. And it shows.\n\nOne Team, One Dream - helping each other out and learning from each other. There will be things you know that your team doesn‚Äôt, and vice versa. Working as one means learning as one.\n\nI love how the Train Story was well written. You‚Äôd know that it wasn‚Äôt written for promotion and marketing, because you can sense the feelings of it even through the screen. You can sense the thoughtfulness and honesty of it. It‚Äôs exciting to scroll through my phone reading it and seeing that the scrollbar has more to load - more to know about Insentra.\n\nI even sent the link to few of my close friends asking them to read all through it- as it‚Äôs worth it.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt just motivate me to learn more, it motivated me to be a better version of myself. Knowing that there‚Äôs a possibility of joining a company that‚Äôs going to help me grow in all different ways, I didn‚Äôt want to miss the chance.\n\nI‚Äôve always been a technical kid growing up. When my mom bought her first phone, I was the first to learn it even though I‚Äôm just on second grade. I would always excel in computer subjects and eventually took Bachelor in Science of Information Technology. It excites me to learn how things work, how it makes life easier. It excites me to automate something and testing it and knowing it works.
